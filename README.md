# Pet Shop

This is a pet service app. This is a project I build in Java using Spring boot technologies. This project is intended to help a shop manage their customer's pet and the employees in charge.

Below is a screen shot to show that the App builds successfully and is accessible on localhost:8080 on my local computer(Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS)
